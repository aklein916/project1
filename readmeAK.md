##Alexa Klein Memory Card Game##

When creating my Memy Game I began by thinking of what I ultimately, and ideally, would want the game to look like and how I would like it to function. I had to scale that back dramatically in order to feel comfortable writing the code and executing the project.
##METHOD##
I began by writing the CSS and HTML in order to have the basic layout done. At first I had each card flipping with CSS transformation, and I later changed that to javascript in order for the card to flip when clicked and have functionality to the click (ex. storing the card to see if it matches the next click).

After I had the layout complete I added the Javascript file to randomize the letters, check for matches and allow the user to play the game.

Next time I would like to spend more time doing psuedocode and nailing that down before beginning to code. I did a litte, but did not break my psuedocode down into smaller steps, making it more challenging to figure out where to begin.

##INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS##
I was comfortable using the gh-pages and branches to create the project.

##UNSOLVED PROBLEMS##
I would have loved to have more time to work on the project, as I feel like until Wednesday I was not really understanding the javascript portion of my game. As a result, while I can get the cards to shuffle in the console, visually they don't randomize or shuffle when the game is loaded. Additionally, I have been working on what happens when the game ends, but have not been able to successfully have that happen (yet). Also, I did not have time to change the letters to images, which I believe would have made the game more interesting to the user and a little more complex. Finally, I spent a lot of time using online resources and looking at examples of code. While this is certainly useful, I should have asked my peers and instructors for support a little sooner, as it related to my project, rather than spending hours trying to apply an online example to my own project.
--html validator said I could not have the attribute "name" in the div tag. It still loads and the game runs, so I decided not to go back and try to fix that with only an hour or so left to work on the project. I was worried it would mess up my code and set me back. 
##USER STORIES##
-As a user I can click and find the matches and am alerted when the matches occur so that I can play the game.
-As an adult I would like the game to be more complex, with various have levels of difficulty to keep me interested.
-As a user I would like to have the game keep score and time as I play through and find matches so I can improve my score.  
-As a player I would like the game to have more visuals and images to make it more appealing and exciting to play.
-As a user I should be able to click a button to restart the game so that I do not have to reload the game each time I want to play.
