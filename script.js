//pseudocode//
//introduce the deck of cards//
//have about 20 cards laid out at once.
//when one card is clicked it turns over. when a second card is clicked it also turns over. If the two cards are the same then they disappear off the page/ or stay flipped over/ or show a photo on them that says they match. The points of the palyer increase with each match. The player continues clicking in pairs of two. If the cards are not a match they are flipped back, face-down, so the player can still click on those cards again to find a match. the number of tries of the palyer increases with each guess, and the number correct increases with each correct pair discovered.
